This reposatory contains 2 packages:

dandb - Calculates distance and bearing between 2 geo locations.

readnav - Reads a json file with pertinent waypoint data. File locations is handled by some hand written code but could be improved on by using something like Viper or gonfig. We'll cross that bridge when needed.
