# golangsandbox

This reposatory contains 2 (_timehopping..._) packages:

* dandb - Calculates distance and bearing between 2 geo locations.
* readnav - Reads a json file with pertinent waypoint data. File locations are handled by some hand written code to read a config file, but could be improved on by using something like Viper or gonfig. We'll cross that bridge when needed.
* makenavplan - Just puts the 2 and 2 together if you will and outputs to console.

Note: _non-standard folders config/ and data/ contain the config.json and navplan.json files. Maybe another thing that could be improved in the real world._

(With this Abe will never lose his way)
